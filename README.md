# SkillForge

Local-first MCP orchestration and portable skill marketplace for serious multi-model coding workflows.

SkillForge is the public repo and docs surface for the `orchestrator-mcp` runtime and skill library. It gives Codex, Claude Code, Kimi Code, and other MCP-capable clients one shared local orchestration layer for safe delegation, model routing, semantic caching, budget-aware fallbacks, and observability.

If your workflow already jumps between Codex, Claude Code, Kimi Code, Ollama, Gemini, or NVIDIA-backed reasoning models, this repo turns that stack into one reusable local tool instead of scattered client-specific prompt glue.

## Why this exists

Most coding agents are strong inside one environment. Real-world developer setups are messier.

- Codex for repo-native implementation
- Claude Code for deeper planning and review
- Kimi Code for IDE-first iteration and MCP-heavy workflows
- Ollama for cheap local capacity
- Gemini or NVIDIA-backed models for multimodal review and specialist fallback

SkillForge gives those workflows one consistent local server surface while keeping the current runtime package name unchanged.

## What it is

This repo works in two modes:

### 1. Local-first MCP server

Run one shared orchestration layer for multiple coding clients and model providers.

### 2. Portable skill marketplace

Browse, inspect, and export standalone skill packs even if you do not want to run the MCP runtime itself.

## Core features

- Backward-compatible MCP tools including `llm_ask`, `llm_chat`, `dispatch_parallel`, `estimate_complexity`, and `llm_orchestrate`
- Cost-aware model routing with fallback chains and budget pressure
- Semantic caching with local SQLite persistence
- Safety guardrails for secret redaction, malicious prompt blocking, model-name validation, and public-release scanning
- Streamlit dashboard for recent runs, cache hits, failures, and estimated spend
- YAML skill registry for reusable routing rules and validation logic
- Safe git-analysis helpers for commit messages, PR descriptions, and review summaries without mutating the repo
- Persona-enhanced marketplace packs with explicit role, voice, reasoning, and response-shape metadata on the global-library surface
- 302 real on-disk skill packs spanning 13 public domains, including 20 advanced first-party packs and the imported SkillForge 2.0 expansion

## Persona architecture

The global-library marketplace packs are no longer just "skill name + prompt". They now carry a
clear specialist posture in their portable surfaces:

- persona: role, experience, traits, specializations
- voice: communication style, tone, and anti-patterns to avoid
- thinking: reasoning steps, verification checklist, decision criteria
- response shape: the sections and must-have output elements a strong answer should include

That makes the pack files easier to install elsewhere, easier to audit, and less likely to collapse
into generic assistant prose once they leave the runtime.

## Why it matters

Without a shared orchestration layer, multi-model setups usually turn into:

- duplicated prompts
- inconsistent routing logic
- no cost controls
- no portable skill layer
- no unified safety checks
- editor-specific configuration drift

SkillForge fixes that by making orchestration local, inspectable, reusable, and portable.

## Install

### Standard install

```bash
pip install "orchestrator-mcp[dashboard]"
```

### Contributor install

```bash
pip install -e ".[dashboard,dev]"
```

Use the Python executable that installed the package. If your machine exposes `python3` instead of `python`, substitute that in the snippets below.

## One-paste installs

### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add orchestrator -- python -m orchestrator_mcp.cli serve
```

Config alternative:

```toml
[mcp_servers.orchestrator]
command = "python"
args = ["-m", "orchestrator_mcp.cli", "serve"]
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add orchestrator -- python -m orchestrator_mcp.cli serve
```

Project config example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "orchestrator": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "orchestrator_mcp.cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Kimi Code

Use a local MCP server with:

- Transport: `stdio`
- Command: `python`
- Args: `-m orchestrator_mcp.cli serve`

A raw example is also included in [`examples/kimi-stdio.json`](examples/kimi-stdio.json).

### Generic MCP client

Any `stdio`-capable MCP client can launch:

```bash
python -m orchestrator_mcp.cli serve
```

See [`examples/codex-config.toml`](examples/codex-config.toml), [`examples/claude-mcp.json`](examples/claude-mcp.json), and [`examples/kimi-stdio.json`](examples/kimi-stdio.json) for copy-paste starting points.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp orchestrator-mcp.yaml.example orchestrator-mcp.yaml
orchestrator-mcp doctor
orchestrator-mcp serve
```

Launch the dashboard:

```bash
orchestrator-mcp dashboard
```

## Cheapest sensible default

For most developers, the best cost-to-capability starting point is:

1. Ollama or Ollama Pro for most coding and parallel delegation
2. Gemini for fast multimodal review and cloud fallback
3. NVIDIA-hosted Kimi or DeepSeek-class models for reasoning-heavy sidecars

If budget matters most, enable `poor_mans_mode` and route to local/Ollama models first.

## Configuration

Important settings in `orchestrator-mcp.yaml`:

- `budgets.daily_usd` and `budgets.weekly_usd` keep model usage under control
- `budgets.poor_mans_mode` aggressively prefers cheap or local routes
- `skills_dir` loads reusable skills
- `pricing` lets you override provider cost tables
- `models` and `workflows` define project-specific routing policy

## Safety model

`orchestrator-mcp` is intentionally narrower than a shell-capable coding agent.

It:

- does not execute shell commands
- does not crawl your filesystem for context
- redacts obvious secrets before outbound model calls
- blocks clear malware, phishing, and credential-exfiltration requests
- includes a release scanner for common leaks such as API keys and absolute local paths

Run the hygiene scan with:

```bash
orchestrator-mcp doctor
```

## Use it as a portable skill marketplace

If you only want the skills layer, you can use the repo as a standalone marketplace:

```bash
orchestrator-mcp skills list
orchestrator-mcp skills show liquid-glass-enforcer
orchestrator-mcp skills export liquid-glass-enforcer --to ./exported-skills
orchestrator-mcp skills export-category --category security --to ./exported-skills
```

The marketplace includes:

- a 302-pack on-disk library in `skills/`
- 13 public-domain catalog lanes plus advanced first-party packs
- 20 advanced first-party packs for orchestration, safety, routing, release hygiene, and AI optimization
- the imported SkillForge 2.0 source bundle preserved in `imports/skillforge-2.0/`
- standalone packs with `README.md`, `SKILL.md`, `skill.yaml`, and `marketplace.yaml`
- real folders you can copy individually into Codex, Claude-oriented workflows, or other markdown-first agent setups

## CLI

```bash
orchestrator-mcp serve
orchestrator-mcp dashboard
orchestrator-mcp doctor
orchestrator-mcp benchmark
orchestrator-mcp cinematic-upgrade --path ./your-project
```
